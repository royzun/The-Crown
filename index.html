         <p>By <a href="https://www.royzun.com/">Roy Zunder</a></p>
        </div>

        <p>Long before the emergence of virtual reality devices such as the Oculus and Apple Glass, there existed the stereograph.
             First conceptualized in 1832 by English physicist Sir Charles Wheatstone, the stereograph, much like our contemporary VR devices, 
             employed optical illusions to make two-dimensional objects appear three-dimensional.</p>

        <p>Existing literature highlights that this technology enjoyed widespread popularity in the United States from the mid-1850s until the early 20th century. 
            "People loved it," noted Laura Schiavo, an assistant professor of museum studies at George Washington University, in a 2017 article by Clive Thompson for Smithsonian Magazine. 
            "Eventually, the stereograph was killed offâ€”by even newer, more bewitching media. Though the craze endured for over 60 years, by the 1910s, 
            postcards had become the hot new photo item to share and collect," Thompson concludes."</p>

        <p>However, data presents a somewhat different picture. Analyzing the distribution of stereograph pictures in the Library of Congress, which holds one of the largest collections of these images, 
            reveals a fluctuation of interest.</p> 
    

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/years.png" alt="years" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <figcaption class="caption">
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
           

        <p> After analysing pictures depicted and produced only in the United States, it becomes evident that while initial excitement was high, it waned quickly. 
            Specifically, the trend shows three peaks of enthusiasm: the first two between the early 1860s and 1870s, and the third in the early 1900s.</p> 

        <p>Notably, from the 1870s onward, there was a period of almost 40 years with no real interest, as indicated by the sharp decline and low production numbers during this time. The final peak in the early 1900s marked a brief resurgence 
            before the technology ultimately faded from popularity.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/stereoscope.png" alt="fifth" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <figcaption class="caption">
                        Photo of a Stereoscope by Robert Kato, <span>The New York Public Library.</span>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
    


        <p> Though, the question holds true: why was such a favorable and ingenious technology replaced by postcards? And why did people lose interest so rapidly?</p>

        <div> 

        <p class="subhead_1">A Modern Hype</p>

        <div>

        <p> These historical questions did not seem to bother the engineers at Meta or Apple, who decided to take Sir Charles Wheatstone's ideas and reimagine them into a product that could reach $3,500 a piece,
             like Apple's Vision Pro. And again, the hype was short-lived. Bloomberg reports that the Vision Pro headset has yet to sell 100,000 units in a quarter since its launch in the US in February, 
             and it faces a 75% drop in domestic sales in the current quarter, according to market tracker IDC.</p>

        <p>A deeper question arises: what is the 3D world that was depicted, photographed, and imagined by Americans in the early 1920s, and why did it fail them so much that they turned to postcards?</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/states.png" alt="years" width="100%" height="auto">
                <figcaption class="caption">
            </figure>
        </div>


        <p> As we can see, New York leads with images of Central Park, while Missouri's photos center around the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Civil War themes dominate in Virginia and Carolina,
            with military facilities and scenes of destruction, respectively. Other notable subjects include Yosemite Valley and San Francisco in California,
            Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, and the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.</p>

        <p>The themes explored are distinctly local, capturing the nuanced realities of American life. One could argue that the medium itself contributed little to these depictions. Once the novelty of the first image fades, subsequent images lose their impact, revealing a limited imagination in the medium's application.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/coney.jpg" alt="fifth" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <figcaption class="caption">
                       "The gorgeous illumination", Luna Park, Coney Island, N. Y. City, 1904 <span>American Stereoscopic Company</span>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
    

        <p> The persistent fascination with virtual realities is still puzzling, particularly as history repeatedly demonstrates that such technologies fail to sustain a lasting market. </p>
